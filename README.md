# Web Payments Demo
The code in this repository implements a demo of the proposed [Web Payments](https://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/) system. In the different subfolders you will find:
* A simple [payment app](https://nelsonlyra.github.io/webpayments-demo/payment-apps/tommypay/).
* A [demo webshop](https://nelsonlyra.github.io/webpayments-demo/merchants/clothing/) which allows you to "purchase" items with web payments.
* [Prototype client builds](https://github.com/nelsonlyra/webpayments-demo/tree/gh-pages/clients) for testing Service Worker based Payment Apps.
